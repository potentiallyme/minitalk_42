# MINITALK  
## A small data exchange program using UNIX signals  

This 42 PARIS project consists in creating a very basic program enabling the user to open a server in the terminal which waits for input, and use a client executable to send messages to the server using its PID  
Other than a small introduction to signals and processes, there is also a small portion of bitwise and understanding how information is sent (essentially breaking it down into bits) which was very interesting  

This project is essentially a step toward the later Minishell project (can be found in my repos) which will use signal handling and a more in-depth handling of processes.  

In this project you can also find my version of printf, named ft_printf, which is implement in my my_libft library, which I use more extensively in later projects.
